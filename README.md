# Movies-ETL

This project is to use Python to clean and merge three large datasets: Kaggle metadata, Wikipedia data, and MovieLens rating data. Upon successful merger, the user can work on a clean and complete dataset with no duplicate columns, standardized format on information such as budget and release date, and more intuitive column names. I also export the movies dataset and ratings dataset into SQL database for better prediction on popular release.
